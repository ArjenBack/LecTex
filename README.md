# LecTex
LecTex or LectureTex if you want.
This is my setup for making lecture notes and summary's of those notes in LaTex.

## Acknowledgment
I am very gratefull to Gilles Castel (a latex guru).
He was an intelligent man who died too young, but at least his work was not in vain. 
He left behind his latex setup that inspired many, including myself.
